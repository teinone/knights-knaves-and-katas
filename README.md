# Refactoring Kata
This is an implementation for Emily Bache's version of the original kata by Terry Hughes.

The original repository [can be found here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

# How to run
You can simply run `test_gilded_rose.py` and `texttest_fixture.py` to see the code in action. `texttest_fixture.py` has been configured to run for 30 days with buffer flushing at each print.

TextTest has not been configured, but the output of texttest_fixture.py should be fully conformant.
